        <h2 id="finding-quantum-gravity-traces-in-our-universe">Finding Quantum Gravity traces in our Universe</h2>

<p>More than a decade ago, the dominant approach to explaining the Physics of our Universe from String Theory was of top-down nature. 
Namely, the question that was asked was:</p>

<p><em>can String Theory deliver a four-dimensional model that correctly explains the Physics of our Universe, ranging from inflation, to subatomic phenomena?</em></p>

<p>Answering such a question proved to be hard, for String Theory predicts <em>too many</em> four-dimensional models, and it is hard to systematically study them and check their consistency with the Physics that we observe.
Thus, in the recent years, the question has been <em>reversed</em>, and the problem of consistency has been rather formulated in a bottom-up fashion.
Indeed, the question that is now asked is:</p>

<p><em>given a four- dimensional effective field theory, which characteristics should it be endowed with in order to actually originate from String Theory?</em></p>

<p>Those theories that can be ‘completed’ within String Theory are said to belong to the <em>Landscape</em> of consistent effective theories, while those that are not are said to be part of the <em>Swampland</em>. The boundaries that separate the Landscape of effective theories from the Swampland are governed by the so-called <em>Swampland Conjectures</em>. These are general criteria that aim at identifying the signatures that Quantum Gravity, or String Theory leaves within lower-dimensional effective field theories. As the name suggests, almost all the criteria proposed are conjectural: they have been checked in several scenarios, but they are devoid of any mathematical proof that could demonstrate their general validity.</p>

<p>My main contributions to the progress of the Swampland program include:</p>

<h3 id="1-characterizing-the-swampland-at-the-boundaries-of-the-field-space">1. Characterizing the Swampland at the boundaries of the field space</h3>

<p>I contributed to a better understanding of how extended objects (in particular, strings and membranes) can enter the formulation of the Swampland Conjectures in the following work:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Swampland Conjectures for Strings and Membranes</strong> <br />
<em>Stefano Lanza, Fernando Marchesano, Luca Martucci, Irene Valenzuela</em> <br />
Published in: <em>JHEP 02 (2021) 006</em> <br />
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15154">PDF</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15154">arXiv</a>, <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/1803587">INSPIRE-HEP</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In a subsequent work, we showed that such objects play a pivotal role in the characterization of the (pathological) Physics that emerge towards some field space boundaries:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The EFT stringy viewpoint on large distances</strong> <br />
<em>Stefano Lanza, Fernando Marchesano, Luca Martucci, Irene Valenzuela</em> <br />

</ul>

<h3 id="2-understanding-the-geometrical-structures-that-define-the-string-landscape">2. Understanding the geometrical structures that define the String Landscape</h3>

<p>During my postdoctoral appointment at Utrecht University, with the supervision of Prof. Thomas Grimm, I got interested in the application of forefront mathematical research in the investigation of effective field theories that originate from String Theory. In this work:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tameness, Strings, and the Distance Conjecture</strong> <br />
<em>Thomas W. Grimm, Stefano Lanza, Chongchuo Li</em> <br />
Published in: <em>JHEP 09 (2022) 149</em> <br />
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00697">PDF</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00697">arXiv</a>, <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/2090843">INSPIRE-HEP</a></li>
</ul>

<p>we first showed how <em>tame geometry</em> and <em>o-minimal structures</em> can help better understand some geometrical structures of consistent effective field theories. Indeed, we illustrated that considering tame geometry might be crucial for a proper formulation of the Swampland Conjectures.</p>
