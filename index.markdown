## My Research, in brief

My research activities follow two main, complementary directions:
1. [Machine Learning String Theory](./research-physics-ml)
1. [Finding Quantum Gravity traces in our Universe](./research-quantum-gravity)

Previously, mostly during my Ph.D., my research has revolved around the following topic: 
* [New supersymmetric theories, to better explain the Physics of our Universe](./research-string-pheno)
