## Machine Learning String Theory

String Theory has revealed to be the most promising candidate for a unifying Quantum Gravity theory. 
Allegedly, within String Theory are encoded the laws that regulate our Universe. 
However, String Theory is a _complicated, entangled beast_, and it is not so straightforward to tell whether String Theory _truly_ explains the Physics of our Universe.
Indeed, firstly, String Theory predicts a gigantic amount of models that could explain our Universe, and it is hard to pick which is the correct one that is fully consistent with our observations.
Secondly, String Theory models are based on sophisticated geometrical constructions, endowed with a huge number of parameters to be tuned.

In recent years, it has become clear that the huge complexity of String Theory can be better addressed _statistically_, rather than systematically, by employing Machine Learning techniques.
Currently, my research mostly revolves around this topic, to which I am contributing following two directions:



### The theoretical approach: what we can _learn_ in Quantum Gravity

Although Neural Network-based Learning can be crucial for learning several predictions of String Theory, it is not clear _what can we actually learn_ or _to what extent we can learn something_.
For instance, it is crucial that compelling problems such as _does String Theory allow for Inflation?_ or _does String Theory include the Standard Model?_ are learnable.
On theoretical grounds, I explore whether key problems such as these can be learned.
To this end, I utilize concepts and theorems from Statistical Learning Theory, and see how these connect with the geometrical structures of the String Theory-originated effective theories. 

As a first step in this direction, in this work

*   **Neural Network Learning and Quantum Gravity** \
    _Stefano Lanza_ \
    Published in: JHEP, vol. 07, p. 105, 2024 \
    [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03245), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03245), [INSPIRE-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2765816)

I have illustrated that the geometrical structures that characterize Quantum Gravity _imply_ the statistical learnability of several problems that one can therein formulate.



### The practical approach: how we can learn features of Quantum Gravity

On practictal grounds, I am applying Machine Learning techniques to address compelling problems in String Phenomenology.
This approach serves, on the one hand, to unearth new, undiscovered properties and patterns of String Theory effective theories via the power of Machine and Deep Learning techniques; on the other hand, such a practical approach is useful to corroborate and substatiate the findings of the above theoretical viewpoint.

Along this direction, in the following work

*   **Machine learning the breakdown of tame effective theories** \
    _Stefano Lanza_ \
    Published in: Eur. Phys. J. C, vol. 84, no. 6, p. 631, 2024 \
    [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03437), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03437), [INSPIRE-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2719851)

I have employed supervised classification algorithms - the _k-nearest neighbor_ and the _Linear Support Vector Machine_ algorithms - in order to predict the kinds of states that break-down stringy effective field theories.
