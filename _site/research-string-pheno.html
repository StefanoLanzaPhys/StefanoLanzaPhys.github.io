        <h2 id="discovering-new-supersymmetric-theories-to-better-explain-our-universe">Discovering new supersymmetric theories, to better explain our Universe</h2>

<p>During my Ph.D., carried under the supervision of Prof. Luca Martucci, I investigated the effective field theories that originate from String Theory, their phenomenological predictions, and their limitations. I especially focused on four-dimensional effective theories exhibiting N=1 supersymmetry. These theories, endowed with the minimal amount of supersymmetry, are prime candidates to explain the (ultraviolet-completion of the) Physics that we observe.</p>

<p>I devoted a large part of my Ph.D. to constructing theories with N=1 supersymmetry from first principles, and including objects that were never included before. Exploiting the so-called superspace formalism, we were able to compute the general N=1 supersymmetric action that includes extended objects, such as strings, membranes, three-branes, and junctions thereof. These investigations culminated in the following work</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>How many fluxes fit in an EFT?</strong> <br />
<em>Stefano Lanza, Fernando Marchesano, Luca Martucci, Dmitri Sorokin</em> <br />
Published in: <em>JHEP 10 (2019) 110</em> <br />
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11256">PDF</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11256">arXiv</a>, <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/1746474">INSPIRE-HEP</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Here, the aforementioned general N=1 supersymmetric action was utilized to illustrate how effects that String Theory predicts – such as tadpole and Freed-Witten anomaly cancellations – are realized purely from a four- dimensional perspective.
These results are thus crucial in order to better understand how the physics of our Universe is connected to that predicted by String Theory.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the details about this research program, you may take a look at my Ph.D. thesis, where I presented the above results with a pedagogical approach:</p>
